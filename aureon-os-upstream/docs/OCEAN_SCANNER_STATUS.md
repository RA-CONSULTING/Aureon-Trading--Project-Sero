## 🔴 Known Issue: Kraken Not Loading

### Problem:
`kraken_client.py` has `aureon_baton_link` import at top which blocks module loading:
```python
from aureon_baton_link import link_system as _baton_link; _baton_link(__name__)
```

This causes:
- `KrakenClient` class never gets defined
- Ocean Scanner can't load Kraken (should be +1,434 pairs)
- Total universe stuck at 1,557 instead of ~3,000

### Root Cause:
`_baton_link(__name__)` tries to import `aureon_queen_hive_mind` which is a massive module with complex dependencies. If that import fails or hangs, the entire `kraken_client` module fails to load.

### Solution Options:
1. **Wrap baton link in try/except** (quick fix)
2. **Make baton link lazy/deferred** (proper fix)
3. **Remove baton link from Kraken client** (cleanest - Kraken is just an API wrapper, doesn't need queen integration)
